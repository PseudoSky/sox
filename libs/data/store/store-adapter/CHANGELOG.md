## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- A backup can no longer be certified `ok` when nothing was actually verified (BL-449, BL-341).

  Post-`VACUUM INTO` reverification ran `only: ['pragma_integrity_check']`, so every probe written after that narrowing — including `fts_index_live` — never ran on the copy. A backup whose full-text index was dead came back `'ok'`. It also read a flag that excludes `unknown` by design, so a probe that could not run **at all** also reported `'ok'`. And `integrity_check` truncated at its 100-message cap read as a clean bill of health.

  - New additive `integrityReport` on `AdapterBackupResult`/`BackupStoreResult`: `status: 'verified' | 'damaged' | 'unverified'`, plus `capped`, `unknownCount`, `damagedCount`, `probesRun` and structured `findings`.
  - `capped` travels via a structural `IntegrityFinding.truncated` boolean — nobody parses prose.
  - `integrityCheck: string` keeps its exact prior semantics for compatibility.

  `unverified` deliberately **keeps** the backup: a store too small to yield an FTS sentinel is healthy, not damaged, and an earlier cut that treated it as failure deleted the backup of a healthy store. Deletion still happens only on `damaged`.

  Verified on a copy of a live 108 MB store: verdict `verified`, six probes instead of one, verification 0.6s → 1.1–2.1s inside a 2.1–3.2s backup.
