# @adhd/sox-host-registry

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 32275f7: Additive: new opencode host surface.

  New `opencodeHost` export from a new `opencode.d.ts` module. New `McpConfig` interface (`keyPath`,
  `value` methods) re-exported as a type. `Surface` interface gains two optional fields
  (`mcpConfig?: McpConfig`, `postInstallHint?: string`). `CapabilityId` union widened with
  `'object-array-merge'` — treated as additive/minor per the standard ecosystem convention for
  widening a string-literal union that consumers write data into rather than exhaustively switch over;
  verified no in-repo exhaustive switch over `CapabilityId` breaks. `claude.d.ts`/`codex.d.ts`/
  `internal.d.ts` carry only `sox`→`soxe` comment rebrands plus documentation of the
  mcp-trust-sync behavior shipped elsewhere. No removed or narrowed export.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 05430d9: Publishing & distribution refactor — the system is now publishable, consumable, and reusable purely
  from `npm install`, and new bundles install the same way (BL-42/BL-43/BL-65/BL-34/BL-33/BL-38).

  - **All 12 `@adhd/sox-*` libs publish public** (`private:false` + `publishConfig.access:public`,
    `engines.node>=20`, `files:["dist"]`) so third parties can `npm i` and import the engine SDK (G3).
    API stability tiers documented in `docs/publishing/api-stability.md` (ADR-0005 / Q2).
  - **CLI is a self-contained esbuild bundle** with an in-package `bin` (`@adhd/sox-cli` →
    `soxe`), in-package `dist`/`files`/`engines`/`publishConfig`, and a bundled registry copy, so
    `npm i -g @adhd/sox-cli` works on a fresh machine with no checkout (G1; fixes BL-34).
  - **Extensions are self-contained bundles (Model A)** carrying zero `@adhd/sox-*` runtime deps;
    `memory-server`/`memory-cli`/`memory-flush`/`memory-daemon` migrated off bare `tsc` to esbuild
    (closes BL-38). Native addons (`better-sqlite3`, `sqlite-vec`) are declared as real runtime
    `dependencies` and installed via a new `npm-package:` install mode (tarball + `npm install`),
    the only path that can deliver transitive native deps to a fresh machine (G2).
  - **Registry portability:** `build-index` emits portable `npm-package:` locators under the
    `SOX_REGISTRY_PUBLISH` signal (was a dormant CDN branch); `check-registry-sync` mirrors it
    (BL-33). The content checksum remains the sole extension identity/integrity authority — the npm
    version only selects which bytes to fetch (ADR-0003 intact; ADR-0005 ratifies the coexistence).
  - **Born-publishable golden path:** `soxe init` scaffolds publish + fresh-machine-install-ready
    packages; a `check-publishable` gate forbids the `workspace:*`/`@adhd`-runtime-dep 404 class.
