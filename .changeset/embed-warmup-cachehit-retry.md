Add `WARMUP_CACHE_HIT_ATTEMPTS` and `warmupOuterBudgetMs()` exports. A cache-hit fastembed warmup now retries up to `WARMUP_CACHE_HIT_ATTEMPTS` (2) times at the existing tight per-attempt budget (`warmupTimeoutMs(true)`, unchanged from BL-376) instead of giving up after a single attempt — a cold-but-cached load that merely took slightly longer than one tight window (e.g. under OS scheduling pressure) no longer strands the shared fastembed child process mid-load while the caller gives up and forgets it ever asked (BUG-EMBED-WARMUP-CACHEHIT-ASSUMES-FAST-LOAD-001). Cache-miss warmups are unaffected: still exactly one attempt at the existing 180s default budget.
