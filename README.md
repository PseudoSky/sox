# sox
A framework for creating solid gold from the odors of the code locker room. Sublime Dox


#### Description

This tool comes with two major components that create a 0 overhead workflow for creating rich project documentation. 

#### Summary
* I think that would be an insanely useful tool. 
* It would completely remove the painful parts of documentation. 
* Itâ€™s 0 to 80% instantly
* It makes 80-100 significantly easier
* Makes the future of the spec and docs adaptable.

## Intelligent Scaffolding

The first part comes in the form of a pluggable interface for extrracting contextual information and from that mapping the information to generators that create README files.

*cli* -> *context assessments* -> *generation of componentized docs*

## User Interface 

The second is an easy to use, beautiful, and simple interface to edit and structure these documents.

* web base ui
* drag and drop structuring
* edit module specific information
* makes modifications in the background
