# Backlog

Project backlog for sox-ecosystem. Each item: what's wrong, where, severity, and a fix sketch.
Observations below were surfaced during the sox-memory real-embedding / MCP-runtime work
(branches `feat/memory-real-embedding` → `fix/tokenguard-workspace-protocol` →
`fix/memory-server-c7-dedupe`, 2026-06-21).

> **Status (2026-06-22): all BL-1 … BL-15 resolved.** Five (BL-1/5/9/11/13) were already in
> committed code; the remaining ten (BL-2/3/4/6/7/8/10/12/14/15) were resolved per the architect
> plans at `docs/plan/memory-system/` and `docs/plan/ecosystem-feedback/`, build/lint/typecheck
> verified cache-busted. One manual follow-up remains under BL-7 (remove the `--scope=user`
> workaround from `~/.claude.json` now that `serve` cascades scopes) — config cleanup, not code.

## Resolved (formerly Open)

### ~~BL-1~~ — `pnpm typecheck` exits 2 on latent tokenguard + scripts errors — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Low (code hygiene; no runtime impact) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-21)
Surfaced after the `@sox/tokenguard-core` workspace-protocol fix (`dabe9ea`) unmasked them.
**Verified fixed:** `pnpm typecheck` (root `tsc --noEmit`) now exits **0**; all nine cited
files are inside the compilation (`--listFilesOnly` confirms) and every cited error is gone
(e.g. `proxy.ts:309` now reads `(vs[0] ?? '')` — the prescribed `undefined` guard). The
mechanical fixes are realized in the working tree (tokenguard `cli.ts`/`mapstore.ts`/`proxy.ts`,
`scripts/new-extension.ts`, `scripts/check-registry-sync.ts) — **committed in`7a30ea5`.**

9 errors (historical):

_tokenguard source:_

- `extensions/services/tokenguard/src/cli.ts(23,1)` — TS6133 `'readline'` unused
- `extensions/services/tokenguard/src/mapstore.ts(32,10)` — TS6133 `'now'` unused
- `extensions/services/tokenguard/src/proxy.ts(170,19)` — TS6133 `'mapper'` unused
- `extensions/services/tokenguard/src/proxy.ts(170,27)` — TS6133 `'adapter'` unused
- `extensions/services/tokenguard/src/proxy.ts(309,19)` — TS2322 `string | string[] | undefined` not assignable to `string | string[]` (needs an undefined guard)

_repo scripts (unrelated to tokenguard):_

- `scripts/check-registry-sync.ts(35,7)` — TS6133 `'tmpRoot'` unused
- `scripts/check-registry-sync.ts(162,7)` — TS6133 `'liveJson'` unused
- `scripts/new-extension.ts(82,96)` — TS2366 function lacks ending return
- `scripts/new-extension.ts(281,91)` — TS2366 function lacks ending return

**Fix sketch:** remove unused declarations; add an `undefined` guard at `proxy.ts:309`;
add explicit returns (or `: void`/`undefined` return types) in `new-extension.ts`. All
mechanical, no behavior change. After: `pnpm typecheck` exits 0.

### ~~BL-2~~ — `embed.ts` real backend uses `bge-base-en-v1.5`, not the nominal nomic model — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Low (works; naming/quality) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
`embed.ts` now carries an explicit comment at `EMBED_MODEL` clarifying it is the _hash-backend_
identifier and that `getActiveEmbedModel()` returns `bge-base-en-v1.5` for the real backend;
the module header documents the real model. The constant is retained for back-compat. Callers
must use `getActiveEmbedModel()`, not `EMBED_MODEL`, as the active-backend proxy.
The `EMBED_MODEL` constant historically read `nomic-embed-text-v1.5-hash`. The real backend
actually loads **bge-base-en-v1.5** (768-dim) because `fastembed` 2.x does not ship
nomic-v1.5. Verified semantically correct (cos(query,relevant)≈0.74–0.82 vs cos(query,unrelated)≈0.50).
If nomic is desired, swap to a lib/runtime that ships it at 768-dim and re-embed (the
`memory_scope.embed_model` pin already forces a clean reindex on model change).

### ~~BL-3~~ — `memory_recall` RRF temporal-recency can outrank semantic similarity for closely-timed writes — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Low (tuning) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
`recall.ts` now applies per-signal RRF weights (`VEC_WEIGHT=1.0`, `FTS_WEIGHT=0.8`,
`TEMPORAL_WEIGHT=0.4`) instead of the implicit 1:1:1 — temporal is now a tiebreaker, not a
primary signal. Weights are overridable per-call via optional `vec_weight`/`fts_weight`/
`temporal_weight` params, so a caller can re-boost recency when desired.
Observed: with three docs written seconds apart, the most-recently-written (less relevant)
doc out-ranked an older, more-relevant doc, because the temporal component of the RRF fusion
dominated the tiny rank-based score deltas. Embeddings are correct; this is a fusion-weight
tuning question. Consider down-weighting recency relative to semantic rank, or widening the
score spread, when corpus writes cluster in time.

### ~~BL-4~~ — Local build hygiene: composite `tsc` leaves stale `dist`; trust `nx build`, not vitest aliases — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Low (dev ergonomics) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
Documented in `CLAUDE.md` under "BUILD VIA NX TARGETS" → "Build vs. test hygiene (BL-4)":
composite `tsc` can leave a stale `dist`; vitest resolves `@sox/memory-core` to a static
`dist` alias so "tests pass" does not prove the runtime/MCP path; always `nx build memory-core
&& nx build memory-server` before memory tests. The nx-targets constraint also bans bare `tsc`.
`libs/memory-core` and the memory-server bundle use `composite: true`. A bare `tsc` after a
source change (or after `rm -rf dist`) can emit nothing because the `.tsbuildinfo` thinks
outputs are current — leaving a **stale `dist`**. `dist` is gitignored and the nx graph wires
`memory-server:build → dependsOn memory-core:build`, so a clean `nx build memory-server`
is correct. But: a vitest run (which transforms TS source, or uses a `resolve.alias` to
source) can PASS while the built `dist` is stale — so "tests pass" does **not** prove the
runtime/MCP path. Always verify runtime behavior against `nx build` output, not vitest.

### ~~BL-5~~ — `@sox/mcp-runtime` consolidation — **Resolved**

**Status:** Resolved. `memory-server` now uses `serve()` + `defineTool()` from `@sox/mcp-runtime`;
hand-rolled readline loop removed. Vendored `compilePolicyFromEnv` kept (standalone child process
cannot reach `@sox/host-runtime` at runtime). Type escape hatches removed; `handleToolCall`
returns `Promise<ToolResult>`, `TOOLS` typed as `Array<Omit<ToolDefinition, 'handler'>>`.

### ~~BL-6~~ — Verify the other sox-memory-bundle members build/run post workspace-glob widening — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Low · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
Verified cache-busted: `memory-daemon`, `memory-cli`, `memory-flush`, `memory-organizer` all
build clean and resolve `@sox/memory-core` (`nx run-many build --skip-nx-cache`, 6/6 incl.
core+server). Each member's `project.json` carries a `description` noting the verification.
The workspace-glob widening (`bec9914`) now links `@sox/memory-core` into all five members
(server/cli/flush/daemon/organizer). Only `memory-server` was deep-tested (build + real MCP
recall). Confirm `memory-cli`, `memory-flush`, `memory-daemon`, `memory-organizer` build and
resolve `@sox/memory-core` at runtime too.

### ~~BL-7~~ — `install` should persist the resolved scope so `serve` needs no `--scope` flag — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Medium (DX / correctness footgun) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
`cmdServe` (`apps/sox/src/main.ts`, committed in `f4d3e48`) now resolves across scopes by
precedence — `SERVE_SCOPE_ORDER = project → user → org → local`, innermost wins — when no
`--scope` is given; an explicit `--scope` restricts to that scope. A user-scope install is
found by `sox serve <id>` with no flag; help text updated. Build+lint verified cache-busted.
**Remaining follow-up below is a manual config cleanup, not code.**
`soxe install --scope=user` writes the user-scope lockfile (`~/.config/extensions/extensions.lock`),
but `soxe serve <id>` defaults to `--scope=project` (cwd-rooted). So a user-scope-installed
extension is invisible to `serve` unless the caller _also_ passes `--scope=user` — which means
the scope decision has to be re-stated at every invocation site (the `~/.claude.json` MCP
entry, `.mcp.json`, etc.). That conditional handling at install-time/launch files is exactly
what we want to avoid.

**Desired:** install should make the resolved scope self-describing so `serve` finds the
extension without a flag. Options to evaluate:

- `serve` resolves across scopes by precedence (project → user → org) instead of a single
  default scope, so a user-scope install is found automatically.
- and/or install records the scope in a stable, cwd-independent index (e.g. the
  `~/.sox`/`SOX_HOME` install-registry) that `serve` consults regardless of cwd.
- and/or install stamps the chosen scope into the generated launch/config artifact so no
  caller has to pass `--scope`.

**Follow-up (do this once BL-7 lands):** remove the `--scope=user` argument from the global
MCP entry in `~/.claude.json` (`mcpServers."memory-server".args`) — it is a temporary
workaround for this gap and should be deleted once `serve` resolves user-scope installs on
its own. Track that removal as the closing step of BL-7.

## Memory subsystem (`@sox/memory-core` + sox-memory-bundle)

Surfaced while migrating a 95-document research corpus into `~/.memory/memory.db` and exercising `memory_recall` via the live MCP (2026-06-21).

### ~~BL-8~~ — `memory_recall` default `token_budget` is far too small for document-scale nodes — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Medium (recall correctness) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
`DEFAULT_TOKEN_BUDGET` raised 4000 → 32000 in `recall.ts`; the `memory_recall` schema default
in `memory-server/extension.json` updated to 32000. The budget guard is unchanged, so an
explicit small `token_budget` still stops early. Document-scale nodes no longer cap `limit:10`
recall at 1 result.
`memoryRecall` defaults `token_budget` to ~4000 (`recall.ts`), and `federatedRecall` to 4000. The assembler stops adding results once the budget is exceeded (`recall.ts:279`), so with document-sized nodes a single result fills the budget and recall returns **1 hit even when `limit` is 10**. Confirmed empirically: same query returned 1 result at default, 10 at `token_budget: 50000`. Fix: raise the default to a sane multi-result value, make it scale with `limit`, and/or document that callers must pass `token_budget`. The `limit` parameter is misleading while the budget silently caps below it.

### ~~BL-9~~ — No edge/link MCP tool; relationships require the organizer or raw SQL — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Medium (graph completeness) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-21)
A `memory_link` tool now exists (memory-server `src/index.ts:294` definition, `:620` handler),
creating directed edges between existing nodes (`DERIVED_FROM`, `SUPERSEDES`, `RELATES_TO`,
`SUPPORTS`, `MENTIONS`). Bulk importers can link chunks to their source document via the MCP
without the organizer or raw SQL. **Committed in `7a30ea5`.**

### ~~BL-10~~ — `initScope` records the `EMBED_MODEL` constant, not the active model — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Medium (bug — embed-model pin is wrong) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
`initScope` (`db.ts`, committed in `7a30ea5`) now records `getActiveEmbedModel()` in both the
`memory_scope` INSERT and the returned object, so the scope pins the real active model
(`bge-base-en-v1.5`) instead of the frozen hash constant — restoring the re-embed-on-model-change
mechanism. (Caveat per the plan: if `initScope` runs before the first `embed()` resolves, the
pin is the hash value until the daemon's reindex updates it.)

### ~~BL-11~~ — In-process `embed()` + `better-sqlite3` crashes ("mutex lock failed") — **Resolved**

**Severity:** High (blocks programmatic/bulk ingest) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-21)
ONNX inference is now isolated in a worker thread (`libs/memory-core/src/embedWorker.ts`,
referenced from `embed.ts:92` and `index.ts:9-10` with explicit "resolves BL-11" notes), so
onnxruntime-node and better-sqlite3 no longer share the libpthread mutex that was corrupted
across the async boundary. The library is safe to call in-process (openDb → embed → memoryWrite).
**Committed in `7a30ea5`.**

### ~~BL-12~~ — `reembedNodes` is defined but not re-exported from the package index — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Low (API consistency) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
`reembedNodes` added to the embedding export block in `libs/memory-core/src/index.ts`. Verified
from built dist: `typeof require('@sox/memory-core').reembedNodes === 'function'` (was `undefined`).

### ~~BL-13~~ — `memory_write` stores whole content as one node; no chunking + embedding truncation — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Medium (recall quality) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-21)
`memory_write` now chunks large content server-side: `splitIntoChunks()` (memory-server
`src/index.ts:360`) splits content exceeding `chunk_size` (param at `:198`, default ~500
tokens) at sentence boundaries, storing each chunk as a separate episode with a `DERIVED_FROM`
edge to the parent. Callers no longer need to pre-chunk document-sized input for usable
default-budget recall. **Committed in `7a30ea5`.**

### ~~BL-14~~ — `memory_recall` lacks result diversity (one verbose source crowds top-N) — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Medium (recall quality) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
`recall.ts` result assembly now enforces a per-source diversity cap of
`max(2, ceil(limit/5))`, keyed on a stable per-source key, so one verbose document cannot fill
top-N — remaining slots fill from other sources. Documented as a diversity proxy (not full MMR,
which would need inter-candidate embedding distances).
After chunked ingest, a single long finding (`work-order-compiler`, many sections) had enough chunks that 3–4 of them filled the top-5 for unrelated queries, burying the genuinely most-relevant finding from another source (e.g. `plan-scheduling/dag-merging` ranked #4 for "parallel scheduling of dependent plan tasks", under work-order-compiler chunks). Add per-source diversity to recall — cap chunks-per-`original_path`/document, or apply MMR — so top-N spans distinct sources.

### ~~BL-15~~ — `serve` permission guard `db_path` allowlist is `~/.memory/**` only — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Low (note) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)
The `db_path` allowlist constraint is now documented for tool callers: `memory_write`/
`memory_recall` `db_path` properties in `memory-server/extension.json` carry a `description`
stating paths must be within `~/.memory/**` (else denied by the host guard, no side effects),
and `memory-server/CLAUDE.md` gains a "Permissions and db_path constraint" section with the
two escape hatches (reconfigure allowlist / symlink into `~/.memory/`).

## Authoring / CLI

### ~~BL-16~~ — `soxe init` accepts ids that `soxe validate` rejects; naming rules undocumented; re-evaluate the rule — **Resolved**

**Severity:** Medium (authoring DX / correctness) · **Status:** Resolved (2026-06-22)

1. **init/validate agreement (bug):** both init surfaces now fail fast on a non-conformant id,
   matching `soxe validate`. `cmdInit` (`apps/sox/src/main.ts`, the `soxe` path) uses the
   canonical `validateId` from `@sox/authoring` (pattern **and** no-type-suffix), exit 1 with a
   clear message; the legacy `scripts/new-extension.ts` (`bin/sox` path) suffix check was
   promoted from warn-only to a hard error (`idSuffixError`). Verified: `soxe init skill
   memory-skill` and `sox init skill memory-skill` both exit 1; `memory-usage` scaffolds.
2. **Documented:** id rules now appear in `init` usage + `--help` and in `docs/guidelines/bundle.md`.
3. **Decision (re-evaluate):** the no-type-suffix rule is **kept globally** (not relaxed for
   bundle members) — one uniform contract; member type is already explicit in `extension.json`
   and the `members/<id>/` path; the `memory-<function>` convention is more informative.
   Rationale recorded in `docs/guidelines/bundle.md`.
Three related problems, surfaced authoring the memory-usage skill as a bundle member:

4. **init/validate inconsistency (bug).** `soxe init skill memory-skill` **scaffolds
   successfully**, but `soxe validate` then **rejects** the result:
   `id "memory-skill" must not end with the type name "skill"`
   (`libs/authoring/src/index.ts:156`). `init` and `validate` must agree — `init` should
   reject (or auto-fix) a non-conformant id at scaffold time, not produce a born-INVALID
   extension. Today the author only learns the id is illegal after a full scaffold.

5. **Naming rules are undocumented.** The id contract (`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` **and** must not
   end with the type name) lives only in code + a test; there is no author-facing doc, and
   `soxe init --help` shows only `init <type> <id>`. Document the id rules — and the bundle
   convention that members are named by **function** (`memory-server`/`memory-cli`), not by
   type — in the init help and an authoring guide, with examples + the rejection reason.

6. **Re-evaluate whether the "no type-name suffix" rule still makes sense under bundling.**
   The rule predates the bundle layout. Inside a bundle, members already live under
   `members/<id>/` with the type explicit in `extension.json`, so a suffix like `-skill` is
   arguably informative (it disambiguates a member's role in a mixed bundle), not redundant.
   Decide: keep globally, relax for bundle members, or drop. (Complied for now by naming the
   skill `memory-usage`, matching the `memory-<function>` sibling convention.)

### BL-17 — bundle/config install does not host-place skill members (only the `--host` path does)

**Severity:** Medium (install correctness) · **Status:** Open
`soxe install --scope=user --update` (the config/lockfile path used to "upgrade a bundle")
**resolves** a bundle's skill member into the lockfile but does **not** host-place it — after
upgrading `sox-memory-bundle` with the new `memory-usage` skill member, the skill was written
to the lockfile (`memory-usage/SKILL.md`) but **not** dropped into `~/.claude/skills/`, so it
was not loadable. Host file-drop only happens on the **declarative `--host` path**
(`sox install <id> --host=claude --scope=user`, `main.ts:631`). Net: upgrading a bundle does
not deploy its skill members; a separate per-member `--host` install is required (the workaround
used here). Fix: the config/bundle install should host-place every member per its
`install.hosts` (so `install --update` of a bundle deploys skills/agents/commands too), or this
two-step requirement must be documented. Closely related to BL-7 (scope/placement semantics).

### BL-18 — `memory-organizer` is a member dir + install-registry record but absent from the bundle manifest `members[]`

**Severity:** Low (manifest/registry consistency) · **Status:** Open / needs-decision
`extensions/bundles/sox-memory-bundle/members/memory-organizer/` exists on disk and appears in
`~/.sox`-side `install-registry.json`, but the bundle manifest's `members[]` lists only
`memory-daemon`, `memory-server`, `memory-flush`, `memory-cli` (and now `memory-usage`) — **not**
`memory-organizer`. The bundle `description` likewise omits it. So `install sox-memory-bundle`
does not deploy the organizer, yet a stale/older install path left it in the install-registry.
**Decide intent:**

- If the organizer **should** ship with the bundle (it builds the graph / does extract-link-
  consolidate, which BL-9/BL-13 rely on), add `{ "id": "memory-organizer", "version": "^0.1.0" }`
  to `members[]` and update the description — note this makes every bundle install also deploy/run
  the organizer daemon (a behavior change, hence not done unilaterally here).
- If it is intentionally **out** of the bundle (optional/experimental, installed separately),
  document why, and reconcile the stale `install-registry.json` record so the registry stops
  advertising a member the manifest doesn't ship.

Either way, manifest ↔ member-dirs ↔ install-registry should be made consistent (a
`check-registry-sync`-style assertion could enforce it).

---

## Resolved (this engagement)

- **Embedding was a hash stub (ADR audit A6)** → configurable backend (`auto|real|hash`),
  real = in-process fastembed bge-base-768 auto-downloaded to a global cache. (`f7ba7c4`, `ccff191`)
- **`pnpm install` 404 on `@sox/tokenguard-core`** → `workspace:*` protocol. (`dabe9ea`)
- **memory-server MCP fell back to hash at runtime** → workspace-glob widening links the
  bundle members so `@sox/memory-core` resolves; verified real semantic recall over the
  MCP stdio path. (`bec9914`, C7 dedupe `8c96865`)
